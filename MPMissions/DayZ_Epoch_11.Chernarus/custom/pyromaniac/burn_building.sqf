/*
How to use: PVDZ_obj_Fire = [_ent,5,time,false,true];
 
> handle=[unit,intensity,time,lifecheck,fade] spawn BIS_Effects_Burn
>
> unit: the name of the object that the fire will be attached to
> intensity: the intensity of the fire. Recommended to use values between
> 0.7 and 10, higher values may be used if desired though.
> time: the time that the fire started. use global variable "time". this is used to keep effects synced for JIP players
> lifecheck: if this is true then the unit will only burn as long as it is dead (!alive unit). set to false to burn things like buildings and
gamelogics
> fade: if true then the fire will die down over time, eventually dying
out. set to false if you want it to keep burning. (affected by rain too).
 
To make a gamelogic named mygamelogic burn forever with a big fire:
PVDZ_obj_Fire=[_ent,10,time,false,false] spawn BIS_Effects_Burn
